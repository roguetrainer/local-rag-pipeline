Data Science: Extracting Insights from Data

Data science is an interdisciplinary field that uses scientific methods, processes, 
algorithms, and systems to extract knowledge and insights from structured and 
unstructured data.

Data Science Workflow:
1. Data Collection: Gathering relevant data from various sources
2. Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies
3. Exploratory Data Analysis: Understanding patterns and relationships
4. Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features for modeling
5. Model Building: Developing predictive or descriptive models
6. Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance
7. Deployment: Putting models into production

Essential Tools:
- Python: Primary programming language with pandas, NumPy, matplotlib
- R: Statistical computing and graphics
- SQL: Database querying
- Jupyter: Interactive development environment

Data scientists combine domain knowledge, programming skills, and statistical expertise.
