Artificial Intelligence (AI) Overview

Artificial Intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, 
especially computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction.

Key AI Concepts:
- Machine Learning: Systems that learn from data
- Deep Learning: Neural networks with multiple layers
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding human language
- Computer Vision: Understanding visual information

AI applications are transforming industries including healthcare, finance, transportation, 
and education. The field combines computer science, mathematics, and cognitive science.
