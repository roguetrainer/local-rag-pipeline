Deep Learning and Neural Networks

Deep learning is a specialized subset of machine learning that uses neural networks 
with multiple layers (deep neural networks) to progressively extract higher-level 
features from raw input.

Neural Network Architecture:
- Input Layer: Receives the raw data
- Hidden Layers: Process and transform the data
- Output Layer: Produces the final prediction

Common Deep Learning Architectures:
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): Excellent for image processing
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): Great for sequential data
- Transformers: Revolutionary architecture for NLP tasks
- Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN): For generating new data

Deep learning has achieved breakthrough results in image recognition, natural language 
processing, speech recognition, and game playing (like AlphaGo).
