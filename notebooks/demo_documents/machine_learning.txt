Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn 
and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing 
computer programs that can access data and learn from it.

Types of Machine Learning:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data
   - Classification: Categorizing data into classes
   - Regression: Predicting continuous values

2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
   - Clustering: Grouping similar data points
   - Dimensionality Reduction: Reducing feature space

3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction and feedback

Popular algorithms include decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, 
and neural networks. Python libraries like scikit-learn and TensorFlow are widely used.
