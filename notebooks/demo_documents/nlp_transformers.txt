Natural Language Processing and Transformers

Natural Language Processing (NLP) enables computers to understand, interpret, and 
generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning.

Key NLP Tasks:
- Text Classification: Categorizing text into predefined classes
- Named Entity Recognition: Identifying entities like names, locations
- Sentiment Analysis: Determining emotional tone
- Machine Translation: Translating between languages
- Question Answering: Providing answers to natural language questions
- Text Summarization: Creating concise summaries

The Transformer Revolution:
Transformers, introduced in 2017, use self-attention mechanisms to process sequences 
in parallel rather than sequentially. This architecture powers models like:
- BERT: Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers
- GPT: Generative Pre-trained Transformer
- T5: Text-to-Text Transfer Transformer

These models have achieved state-of-the-art results across numerous NLP benchmarks.
